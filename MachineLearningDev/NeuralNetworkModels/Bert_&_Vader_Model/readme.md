# Phishing and Smishing Detection using BERT and VADER

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of two models for phishing and smishing detection:
1. BERT: Fine-tuned for classifying messages and emails as either "Safe" or "Phishing".
2. VADER: Used for sentiment analysis to identify emotional manipulation or urgency in messages.

Unfortunately, the pre-trained BERT model could not be uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations. If you would like to use the model, you will need to download the datasets and retrain the model by running the provided Jupyter notebook.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Download the Datasets

The original datasets are too large to include in this repository. To run the full implementation, you need to download two datasets:
1. [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
2. [Phishing Email Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elnahas/phishing-email-detection-using-svm-rfc)

Once downloaded, place the dataset files in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook before running the code.

### 2. Training the BERT Model
Since the BERT model could not be uploaded, you will need to train the model yourself using the provided Jupyter notebook. Hereâ€™s how:

Download the datasets and place them in the same directory as the notebook.
Run the Implementing and Evaluating BERT and VADER Model.ipynb notebook to fine-tune the BERT model.

#### Example for Loading the Pre-trained Model:
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load the model and tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./BERT_Model')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./BERT_Model')

# Use the model for inference on new messages
message = "Your account has been suspended. Click here to verify."
inputs = tokenizer(message, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)
outputs = model(**inputs)
