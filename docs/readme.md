Install Git/GitHub.

Or user interface app: GitHub desktop app download: [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)

#### Access preparation (GitHub leads)

- Make sure the master branch is protected
- Collect project member GitHub accounts
- GitHub leads with owner access of the repo add project members to the repo (add to teams in Hardhat organisation on GitHub)
- Give access to leads and code reviewer access to master branch (edit and approve pull requests)

#### Cloning GitHub

### Android studio

After forking and cloning GitHub repository, download and install Android studio

Android Studio Download: [Download Android Studio & App Tools - Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Open the **local path** where you‚Äôve cloned your GitHub

![](inserts/android1.png)  

![](inserts/AS%20open.png)

1: Device manager > run > 2: running devices

![Picture1.png](inserts/Picture1.png) 

When there‚Äôre pop ups about updating AGP, click update > run selected steps. It might take a while.

![](inserts/AS%20update.png)

This is our app

### Planner (replacing Trello)

Tasks of each team are separated by labels, use filter function to hide other teams

![](inserts/planner.png)

1. Tasks of each team are separated by labels, use filter function to hide other teams¬†
   
   - [Common problem] tasks disappearing!: no tag added and not showing 'no label' in filter

2. When adding new tasks, remember to pick labels

3. Pick a task by assigning yourself to the card in backlog

4. Start working: Move task from backlog to sprint in progress, comment you've started working, and update the comments as you progress, including any documentation

5. Join a task to collaborate: First communicate with the other people on the card to ask about their progress to avoid repeated work

6. Finishing a task: move to completed

7. Feel free to come up with new task ideas for yourself and the project! But check with team leaders or the mentor first

## Contributing to GitHub

### Contrubuting your changes using GitHub (branches)

Now you should have made a branch on the Hardhat company repository and cloned to your computer, and made changes in the cloned folders.

#### 1. Regular commits to save changes

On GitHub Desktop: write a summary and make a commit

![](inserts/commit.png)

Using Git CMD:

```
git commit -m "summary message"
```

#### 2. Regularly update your branch from upstreams

on GitHub Desktop: Branches > Update from master

![](inserts/update%20from%20master.png)

#### 3. Resolve conflicts

Fetch origin

![](inserts/fetch%20origin.png)

Resolve conflicts 

![](inserts/resolve%20conflict.png)

> (Personally I like using vscode since it can recognise conflict notation)

> To open in vscode, if your default editor is Android Studio, you can change it by:

> File > Options > Integrations > External editor > Visual Studio Code > Save

> In MacOS it could be GitHub Desktop > Settings/Preferences

> Use the same process to change to other editors

Make sure the app is working after your changes and commit any changes 

Push the local commits to origin

![](inserts/push%20origin.png)

#### 4. Make pull requests

On company GitHub website [Compare ¬∑ Hardhat-Enterprises/smishing ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/Hardhat-Enterprises/smishing/compare)

![](inserts/PR.png)

Choose the master branch (or AI-models) as head, your branch as compare > Create pull request.

![](inserts/compare.png)

### GitHub (forking, before T2 2024)

Install Git. For windows use git bash from here: [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)¬†

GitHub desktop app download: [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)

Fork the smishing detection repo [GitHub - Hardhat-Enterprises/smishing: An AI-drive model driven to discern the legitimacy of SMS messages.](https://github.com/Hardhat-Enterprises/smishing) to your account

** For the AI team, we do need to **unclick** ‚Äòcopy the
main branch only‚Äô, as we will be using the AI-Models branch

Go to your own repository, copy the URL

Then clone to your computer

Or if you‚Äôre using GitHub desktop:

Click Current repository > add> clone repository > **URL** > paste URL of your repository and the **local path** you want to save it
to
